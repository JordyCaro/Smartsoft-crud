# CrudSmartsoft

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.4.

## Description

CrudSmartsoft is a sample application that uses Angular to simulate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users. It utilizes the [ReqRes.in](https://reqres.in/) public API service to simulate these operations. It's important to note that, although the application shows positive responses from the server while simulating creating, editing, and deleting users, in reality, these operations are not being performed.

## Run the Project

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Then, run `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.

## Project Structure

The application is structured with components, services, and styles. You can explore the source code in the `src/` directory for more details on how it is built.

## API Service - ReqRes.in

This application uses the [ReqRes.in](https://reqres.in/) public API service to simulate CRUD operations on users. Although the application displays positive responses, it's crucial to understand that no real changes are made to the database, as it's a testing service.
